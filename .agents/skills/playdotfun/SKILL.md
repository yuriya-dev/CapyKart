description: Monetizes browser games with Play.fun by guiding game registration, rewards and leaderboard setup, SDK integration, and deployment. Use when the user says "monetize my game", "add Play.fun", "add token rewards", "add a leaderboard", "register my game", "deploy so players earn rewards", or "launch a Playcoin". Do NOT use for generic game design, unrelated Solana questions, or non-game web apps.
license: MIT
compatibility: Requires Node.js, Bash, local file access, internet for auth and deployment, and Play.fun MCP server for account and game operations.

## When to use

Use this skill whenever users need to integrate a game with Play.fun or fetch data from Play.fun. You can also use this skill to help guide users through different workflows of Play.fun.

## How to use

When a user asks you to integrate a game with Play.fun, you MUST follow the integration workflow below. Do not skip steps. Create a task list to track progress through each phase.

### Integration Workflow

When integrating a game (new or existing) with Play.fun, follow these phases in order. Create tasks for each step and complete them sequentially.

#### Phase 1: Authentication

Before any authenticated operation, verify credentials are set up.

1. **Check auth status** — Run `node skills/scripts/playfun-auth.js status` to see if credentials exist
2. **Set up credentials if missing** — Follow the [Auth Setup](auth/SKILL.md) guide. Start the callback server and instruct the user to authenticate via their browser
3. **Verify credentials work** — Use the `test_connection` MCP tool to confirm access. **Save the returned user ID** — this is the **API key** that goes in the `<meta name="x-ogp-key">` tag later

Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until credentials are verified.

#### Phase 2: Build the Game

4. **Build or modify the game** — Create/update the game code. Do NOT add any Play.fun SDK integration yet — get the core game working first. **Use safe area insets in your layout**: backgrounds and canvas should fill the full viewport (`100vw × 100vh`), while all game UI (HUD, buttons, controls) must use `var(--ogp-safe-top-inset, 0px)` and `var(--ogp-safe-bottom-inset, 0px)` for margin/padding. For canvas games, read the insets via JS and offset UI drawing. See [Safe Area Layout](sdks/best-practices.md#safe-area-layout)
5. **Test the game works standalone** — Open in browser and verify gameplay functions correctly without SDK (safe area variables fall back to 0px)

#### Phase 3: Register the Game on Play.fun

6. **Choose a game name and description** — Ask the user or generate a fun, descriptive name
7. **Prepare a game image** — Find an existing image or generate a placeholder. **⚠️ CRITICAL: You MUST follow the [Image Safety Rules](rules/game-upload.md#️-mandatory-base64-image-safety-rules) exactly or you will crash.** The short version: (1) get/create an image file on disk, (2) run `./skills/scripts/image-to-base64.sh <image> --data-uri --file /tmp/game_image_b64.txt`, (3) Read the text file with the Read tool, (4) pass the string to `register_game`. NEVER output base64 to stdout. NEVER read binary image files with the Read tool.
8. **Deploy the game to get a public URL** — If the game needs hosting, use the [GitHub Pages Deploy](github-pages/deploy.md) guide. The game URL must be publicly accessible
9. **Register the game** — Use the MCP `register_game` tool with: name, description, gameUrl, platform, base64Image, and anti-cheat limits (see [Best Practices](sdks/best-practices.md) for limit recommendations based on game type). Save the returned **`id`** (game UUID) — this is the **game ID** that goes in `sdk.init({ gameId })` later
10. **Confirm registration** — Use the MCP `get_my_games` tool to verify the game appears in the user's game list

Do NOT proceed to Phase 4 until you have a valid `gameId` from registration.

#### Phase 4: Integrate the Play.fun SDK

11. **Choose SDK approach** — Ask the user or decide based on their needs:
    - **Browser SDK** ([Reference](sdks/browser.md)) — For prototypes, demos, game jams. No server-side validation
    - **Server SDK** ([Reference](sdks/server.md)) — For production games with token rewards and anti-cheat
    - **Hybrid** ([Reference](sdks/hybrid.md)) — Both Browser widget + Server validation (recommended for production)
12. **Add the SDK with real credentials** — Follow the chosen SDK reference. For Browser SDK integration:
    - Add meta tag: `<meta name="x-ogp-key" content="your-api-key" />` — value is the **creator API key** (user UUID from dashboard), NOT the gameId or gameKey
    - Add script: `<script src="https://sdk.play.fun"></script>`
    - Use `OpenGameSDK` class (NOT PlayFunSDK)
    - Use defensive patterns: `typeof` guard, `sdkReady` flag, `sdk && sdkReady` checks, try/catch, score > 0 check (see [Browser SDK Snippets](snippets/browser-sdk.md))
    - Init with **game ID**: `sdk.init({ gameId: 'your-game-id' })` — this is the `id` field from the `register_game` response, NOT the API key
13. **Wire up scoring** — Integrate `sdk.addPoints()` during gameplay and `sdk.endGame()` at game end (for Browser SDK) or server-side `savePoints()` + `sdk.refreshPointsAndMultiplier()` (for Hybrid)
14. **Test SDK integration** — Open the game, verify the Play.fun widget appears, play a round, and confirm points are submitted

#### Phase 5: Deploy and Verify

15. **Re-deploy with SDK integration** — Push updated code to the hosted URL
16. **Update game registration if URL changed** — Use MCP `update_game` tool if the game URL changed
17. **Final verification** — Play the game at its public URL, verify points save, check the leaderboard with MCP `get_game_leaderboard`
18. **Playcoin launch (optional)** — The `launch_playcoin` MCP tool requires Privy wallet auth and **will fail with HMAC credentials**. Direct the user to launch via their game page on the [Play.fun dashboard](https://play.fun/dashboard) instead
